String Palindrome:

rev = ""
str1 = "test"
count1 = len(str1)
while count1 > 0:
    rev = "" + rev + str1[count1 - 1]
    count1 = count1 - 1
if rev == str1:
    game.splash("string is palindrome")
else:
    game.splash("string is not palindrome")


Check amount of "a":

count1 = 0
str1 = "We are a family"
for i in str1:
    if i == "a" or i == "A":
        count1 = count1 + 1
game.splash("total number of a is ", count1)

Calculate squares:

for i in range(1,11):
    game.splash(i*i)
